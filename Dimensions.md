##Dimensions

For the dimensions I'll be using 30x32x10 (W x L x H) cm. The main garbage collecting area will be 21x28(W x L)cm and then I'll add 10cm on both sides for the components and wires.
I'll also add 2cm on the back of the rover for some room to pass wires from one side of the rover to the other.The bottom of the rover will be a flat sheet of steel
