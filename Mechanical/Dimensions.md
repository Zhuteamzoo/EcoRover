# Dimensions

EcoRover is a compact autonomous robot designed to collect small trash items efficiently in indoor and outdoor environments. This document summarizes the physical dimensions and design considerations.

## Physical Dimensions

| Parameter           | Value           |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Length              | 30 cm          |
| Width               | 32 cm          |
| Height              | 10 cm          |
| Approximate Weight  | ~5 kg          |

## Design Considerations

- **Compact footprint:** 30 Ã— 32 cm allows easy navigation through narrow spaces.
- **Low height (10 cm):** Improves stability and lowers the center of gravity.
- **Weight (~5 kg):** Includes frame, motors, electronics, and battery, providing a balance between mobility and payload capacity.
- **Wheelbase and wheel size:** Optimized for torque and speed to carry additional load, such as collected trash.
- **Modular design:** Allows for future upgrades, including larger bins, improved mobility, or sensor additions.

## Notes

- Dimensions are external and approximate.
- Design choices were made to optimize stability, maneuverability, and load-carrying capacity.
