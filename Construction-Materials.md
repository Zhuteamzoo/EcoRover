# ðŸ§±Rover Frame & Construction Materials

##  Wall Material
The walls of the EcoRover will be made from **1.5 mm aluminum sheets**, chosen for their balance of **lightweight** structure and **durability**. The total surface area required for the walls is **2,544 cmÂ²**.

---

##  Assembly Method
To assemble the frame:
- **Corner braces (1 inch)** will be used to connect the walls together.  
- **M3 bolts (12 mm length)** with washers and nuts will secure the braces in place.  
- Each pair of adjacent walls will be joined with **1 corner brace**, ensuring a rigid and stable structure.

---

##  Brace Distribution
- **8 walls total**  
- **8 corner braces**: one between each pair of walls  
- **14 corner braces**: to attach the walls to the base  
  - (The two smaller front walls beside the ramp use 1 brace each.)  
- **Total corner braces required:** 22

##  Tools Required
- **Jigsaw** â€” for cutting aluminum sheets to size  
- **Power drill** â€” for drilling precise bolt holes  
- **Screwdriver & wrench** â€” for tightening bolts and braces

##  Notes
- All wall panels will be securely fastened to ensure structural integrity and minimize vibration.  
- Aluminum sheets provide corrosion resistance, making the rover suitable for outdoor use.  
- Proper alignment during assembly will be critical to maintain a tight seal around the collection area.
